- Add functions to color cubes and digits
- Add functions to get specified vertex of cube (top left, bottom right)
- Stutters when loading background image, maybe fix that
- Not sure if the buffer orphaning strategy is good or even implemented correctly. Maybe try something else.
- I should probably pass dt and use that for velocities. I've had problems with the threshold float compare.
- Maybe initialize AVLTree by inserting really quickly and running the full animations
- How to add other animations like color fading, line growth
